drawing_globals.py - A module containing global state within the
graphics.drawing suite (which is, in principle, mostly specific to
one "GL resource context" (display list namespace, etc)). For historical
reasons, a lot of its state is assigned from outside, and some of it
is not in principle specific to a resource context but is either a
constant or ought to be part of an argument passed to drawing routines.

@version: $Id$
@copyright: 2004-2009 Nanorex, Inc.  See LICENSE file for details. 

WARNINGS:

Variables can be (and are) dynamically added to this module at runtime.
Note: Setting globals here should not be (but, unfortunately, is presently)
done as a side effect of loading other modules. It makes the imports of those
modules falsely appear unnecessary, since nothing defined in them is used.
It also confuses tools which import the module in which the assignment is
used, but not the one which makes the assignment.

Some of the variables contained here are mode control for the whole drawing
package, including the ColorSorter suite.  Other parts are communication between
the phases of setup and operations, which is only incidentally about OpenGL.
Other things are just geometric constants useful for setting up display lists,
e.g. a list of vertices of a diamond grid.

Usage:

Import it this way to show that it is a module:

  import graphics.drawing.drawing_globals as drawing_globals

Access variables as drawing_globals.varname .

TODO:

Desireable refactoring: Note that most of this state really belongs
in an object that corresponds to each "GL display list namespace"
aka "GL resource context",
i.e. each OpenGL shared resource pool of display lists, textures,
shaders, VBOs, etc.

In current code, we require all OpenGL drawing
contexts to share that state, so we can get away with keeping it
as globals in a module. Even so, this ought to be refactored, since
this way it makes the code less clear, causes import cycles and
dependencies on import order, confuses pylint, etc.

(Bruce 090303 is doing related cleanup by introducing ShaderGlobals
and moving shader prefs into GLPrefs, but the fundamental change
is still needed.)

# more imports are kept below, since they will be refactored into a separate module

# A singleton instance of the GLPrefs class.
# This is used in only these ways:
# - by old code (perhaps all being refactored away circa 090304)
# - to initialize glpane.glprefs when there is no other source.
# It must be initialized during import of this module,
# or some code would risk importing a value for it from before
# it was initialized.
# If this causes an import cycle, it can be moved to another module,
# since it's not otherwise used in this module.

<body>

<h1>QuteMolX 0.5.1</h1>
QuteMolX is an interactive, high quality molecular visualization application forked off of the original code (<a href="http://qutemol.sourceforge.net/">QuteMol</a>) written by Marco Tarini and Paolo Cignoni of the Visual Computing Lab at the Institute of Information Science and Technologies (ISTI), an institute of the Italian National Research Council (CNR). QuteMolX exploits current GPU capabilites through OpenGL shaders to offer an array of innovative visual effects. QuteMolX visualization techniques are aimed at improving clarity and understanding of the 3D shape and structure of large complex molecules.
<p>
This is QuteMolX 0.5.1 as of April 25, 2008.

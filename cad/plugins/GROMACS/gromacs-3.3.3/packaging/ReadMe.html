<h1>GROMACS 3.3.3</h1>
<a href="http://www.gromacs.org/">GROMACS</a> (GMX) is an extremely high performance, open source, and cross-platform package used to perform molecular dynamics simulation of systems with hundreds to millions of particles. NE1 currently uses GROMACS as an energy minimization engine option. Also included with the binary installers is <a href="http://mcpp.sourceforge.net/"><tt>mcpp</tt></a>, a free, open source, portable C preprocessor. A C preprocessor is required for GROMACS use, so we've included one since some platforms don't come with one.
<p>
This is GROMACS 3.3.3 as of April 25, 2008.

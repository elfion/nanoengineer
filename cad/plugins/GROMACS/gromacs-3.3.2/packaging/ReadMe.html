<h1>GROMACS 3.3.2 + HDF5 Patch #2</h1>
<a href="http://www.gromacs.org/">GROMACS</a> (GMX) is an extremely high performance, open source, and cross-platform package used to perform molecular dynamics simulation of systems with hundreds to millions of particles. NE1 currently uses GROMACS+HDF5 as an energy minimization engine option. The +HDF5 comes from our experimental <a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/">HDF5</a>-based simulation results file format augmentation. The HDF5 file format won't affect non-HDF5 GMX operation. Also included with the binary installers is <a href="http://mcpp.sourceforge.net/"><tt>mcpp</tt></a>, a free, open source, portable C preprocessor. A C preprocessor is required for GROMACS use, so we've included one since some platforms don't come with one.
<p>
This is GROMACS 3.3.2 + HDF5 Patch #2 as of April 25, 2008.

<h3>Post-install Notes</h3>
If you have not installed this from the NanoEngineer-1 Suite installer you will have to modify your preferences to enable NanoEngineer-1 to use this plugin.
<ol>
  <li> Launch NanoEngineer-1
  <li> Choose Tools -> Preferences -> Plug-ins
  <li> Check the box for GROMACS and input the full path to the mdrun executable including its file name. For example, on Windows it may be C:\GROMACS_3.3.2+HDF5_p2\bin\mdrun.exe)
  <li> Check the box for cpp and input the full path to the mcpp executable including its file name. For example, on Windows it may be C:\GROMACS_3.3.2+HDF5_p2\MCPP\bin\mcpp.exe)
  <li> Click Ok.

\b \cf0 Nanorex NanoEngineer-1 Version VERSION_GOES_HERE\

\b0 DATE_GOES_HERE\
\
NanoEngineer-1 is an open-source (GPL) 3D multi-scale modeling and simulation program for nano-composites with special support for structural DNA nanotechnology. It features an easy-to-use interactive 3D graphical user interface for designing and modeling large, atomically precise composite systems.\
\

\fs25 Currently, NanoEngineer-1 and its installers should work properly on MacOSX 10.4+.  Some errors did occur during testing on MacOSX 10.3.  For more information, please check our online documentation {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nanoengineer-1.net/mediawiki/index.php?title=Online_Readme#Known_Issues_and_Bugs"}}{\fldrslt \ul here}}.\
\
Note: The default install location is /Applications/Nanorex, which the installer reports as "Nanorex".  This folder will be created if it doesn't exist, and inside that we install the folder NanoEngineer-1_vVERSION_GOES_HERE.  You may change the parent directory of the install, but NanoEngineer-1_vVERSION_GOES_HERE will be placed inside whatever folder you choose.}

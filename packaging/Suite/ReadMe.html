<h1>The Nanorex NanoEngineer-1 1.1.1 Application Suite</h1>
NanoEngineer-1 (NE1) is an open-source (GPL) 3D multi-scale modeling
and simulation program for nano-composites with special support for
structural DNA nanotechnology. It features an easy-to-use interactive
3D graphical user interface for designing and modeling large,
atomically precise composite nanosystems.

<p>
In addition to NE1, this Suite includes:
</p>
<ul>

  <li> GROMACS - an extremely high performance, open source, and
cross-platform package used to perform molecular dynamics simulation of
systems with hundreds to millions of particles. NE1 currently uses
GROMACS as an energy minimization engine option.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li> QuteMolX - an interactive, high quality molecular visualization
application aimed at improving clarity and understanding of the 3D
shape and structure of large complex molecules. Users can
"launch-and-load" QuteMolX directly from NE1. <a href="http://www.nanoengineer-1.com/QuteMolX/">Learn more...</a>
  </li>
</ul>

This is the NanoEngineer-1 1.1.1 Application Suite as of July 16, 2008.
